The statement released on social media networks, reserved the right of the ELN to defend itself against \"attacks by state forces, made up of regular troops, paramilitaries and drug gangs in various regions of the country\". \r\n \r\nThe guerilla group's statement urged the Iván Duque governement to suspend military operations and to resume dialogue with ELN delegates in Cuba to agree on a bilateral and temporary cessation. \r\n \r\nThe ELN also made other demands in the statement including the release of political prisoners, the free provision of the COVID-19 test kits and that \"health must once again be an inalienable right, mandatory coverage by the State\", among others.\r\n\r\nThe ELN's unilateral ceasefire was not reciprocated by the Colombian government. It was termed as \"insufficient\" by the Colombian government's High Commissioner for Peace Miguel Ceballos, who called for the ELN to “extend [its] terms indefinitely” and comply with the Government's set pre-conditions for resuming peace negotiations.",

The Ambazonia Governing Council, which is one of the biggest groups, said that a unilateral ceasefire would open the way for government troops to march unopposed into territory under its control.\r\n\r\nThe Cameroonian government did not reciprocate the ceasefire, with clashes between military and separatists continuing throughout April.",

Government forces were ordered to stop offensive operations against armed communist rebels so the state could focus on efforts to counter COVID-19. Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the President directed the Department of National Defense (DND) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to issue the Suspension of Offensive Military and Police Operations (Somo) to implement the ceasefire.\r\n\r\nBoth the police and the military welcomed the ceasefire, saying this would allow them to focus on responding to the threat of COVID-19 whilst remaining on defense.",
